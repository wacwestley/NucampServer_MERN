Welcome to my final project created during Nucamp Bootcamp.
This Nucampsite showcases all I have learned about the MERN stack.

Some parts of the site are intentionally broken.
An example is the feedback form throwing an error on submission.
This is because there is no backend to handle the feedback form.

This project goes with NucampClient_MERN found here at:
